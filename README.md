National Health Assessment & Alcohol Reduction Strategy in India
📌 Project Overview
Objective: A data-driven analysis of alcohol consumption patterns across Indian States and Union Territories.

Scope: Identifies deep-rooted socio-economic challenges and categorizes regions into risk profiles to pinpoint economic drain.

Goal: Establish a roadmap for change via a dual-pillar strategy:

Technological Safeguards: Protecting the younger generation from early exposure.

Family Wealth Plan: Transitioning alcohol expenditure into long-term financial assets (The "Sobriety Dividend").

🧪 Methodology: Exploratory Data Strategy (EDS)
The project utilizes EDS to analyze the 2021 Alcohol Consumption dataset through a structured pipeline:

Data Processing Pipeline
Cleaning & Normalization: * Addressed data irregularities and negative percentage values.

Utilized clipping algorithms to ensure analytical consistency.

Pattern Recognition: * Identified "Rural-Urban Disparity."

Found rural male consumption (19.92%) significantly higher than urban centers (16.53%).

Unsupervised Machine Learning: * Implemented K-Means Clustering to group states into three distinct risk zones.

🤖 Machine Learning & Analytics
Clustering Risk Zones
Using Scikit-learn, states were categorized based on gendered consumption percentages:

🔴 High Risk (Cluster 2): States like Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim (Male consumption >45%).

🟡 Moderate Risk (Cluster 0): States like Telangana and Goa (~34% consumption) — identified as a "wealth trap."

🟢 Low Risk (Cluster 1): Majority of states with consumption levels around 18%.

Correlation Analysis
Household Habit Discovery: Heatmap analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between male and female consumption within the same household.

Insight: Suggests alcohol use is an environmental habit affecting the entire family unit rather than an individual choice.

🛡️ Strategic Interventions: The "Triple-Lock" Framework
Proposed automated and legislative "locks" to protect minors:

Digital Lock: Aadhaar-linked biometric API for all alcohol transactions to automate age-gating.

Educational Lock: A neuroscience-based curriculum focusing on prefrontal cortex development (moving away from moral policing).

Legal Lock: Establishing 300-meter "Sacred Zones" around schools where retail is prohibited.

💰 The Sobriety Dividend (Financial Modeling)
Modeling the redirection of a monthly alcohol spend (approx. ₹4,000) into a prosperity fund (12% annual yield):

20-Year Projection: Results in a corpus of approximately ₹40 Lakhs.

Utility: Sufficient for higher education or clearing home loans.

💻 Technical Implementation
Data Normalization (SQL)
SQL

-- Ensuring data consistency by removing negative values
UPDATE National_Health_Data 
SET Consumption_Value = 0 
WHERE Consumption_Value < 0;
Wealth Projection (SQL)
SQL

-- Calculating cumulative savings for the Family Wealth Plan
SELECT User_ID, 
       SUM(Daily_Savings) AS Total_Principal, 
       (SUM(Daily_Savings) * 1.12) AS Projected_Yearly_Growth 
FROM User_Savings_Log 
WHERE Transaction_Date >= '2025-01-01' 
GROUP BY User_ID;
